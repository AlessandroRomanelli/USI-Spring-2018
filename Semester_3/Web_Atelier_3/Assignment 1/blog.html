            <p>Nowadays the need for basic web skills is becoming more and more frequent when applying for office positions. Having some knowledge about how a website works is not only fundamentally helpful to navigate the Web, but it can also be a powerful enhancement to a person’s thought process.
            <br/><br/>Web development exposes many computer science problems that are unknown to most people: like having to struggle with rules’ overrides, algorithms, efficiency and logic challenges.
            <br/><br/>It’s no wonder why many people start off developing web pages as a hobby but end up pursuing well-payed positions to make a job out of something they have a passion for.
            <br/><br/>This is mostly due to the dual nature of web programming: it’s challenging and rewarding for the developer from a technical perspective, as well as inspiring when it comes to apply some style and bring order to a messy pile of content. The feeling and the high that one gets when successfully styles his own page is second to none and it really pays off in terms of satisfaction not to use any external help.
            <br/><br/>Is then web development something that everyone is going to need in the future? No, but is it something that can be helpful for an individual? Absolutely yes!</p>

              <p>Since humanity began, men have observed the space and the stars in the hope of finding something more.
              <br/><br/>The sky has always be seen as a limit to our possibility, and the only thing that could go past it was our imagination, but, in the last centuries, we have been able to start observing what really lies outside our reach and understand it. We have categorized and named astral bodies of the universe, like the red planet Mars, which is probably the most popular of them.
              <br/><br/>Mars has gained all of its fame because it is really close to the earth and it is, theoretically, livable. Regarding that, Elon Musk, CEO of <a href="https://www.spacex.com/" target="_blank">SpaceX</a>, has started a project in order to make <q>human life multiplanetary</q>.
              <br/><br/>This project is going to use the next-generation rocket, called Big Falcon Rocket. This rocket is going to be able to land, like other SpaceX's rockets, and will also have a hold large enough
              to send as many resources and people as necessary. The first rockets of the project are going to take off from Earth in the next couple of years and will start to bring on Mars the primary resources needed to create the first city.
              <br/><br/>Elon Musk hopes to ultimate the project before the year 2028, but in the meantime he is also going to use the BFRs for other purposes, like travelling from one major city on Earth to another one. If this is going to happen, in the future, we are
              going to be able to reach every city on Earth in less than one hour.</p>

          <h2>Bad Times At El Royale</h2>
          <small class="date">24<sup>th</sup> of September, 2018

            <p>Bad times at El Royale is an american film which is scheluded to be
              released on October 12, 2018. It is a thiriller written and directed by Drew
              Goddard, the one who won National Board of Review Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for
              the screenplay of "The Martian". It is a movie produced and distribuited by the 20th Century Fox.
              <br><br>
              This film sees Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman, Nick Offerman and Chris Hemsworth as
              the main stars: set in the 1960s, Bad Times at the El Royale follows seven strangers who find
              themselves at the El Royale, a novelty hotel at the border of California and Nevada. Seven strangers with seven
              different secrets and as I could understood from the trailer, these will come up in the course of the film.
              <br><br>
              I think this movie takes a sort of inspiration from the 2015 Tarantino movie, “The Eightful Eight”: I mean what
              I find similar is the skeleton of the plot, 8 strangers in this case who find themselves in a lost western hostel as
              the 7 ones in El Royale.
              I feel that  Bad times at El Royale will be a discussed movie but at the same time appreciated by the people. I can’t wait to see it in cinemas.
